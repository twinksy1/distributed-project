To run this web application, Nodejs is needed as well as the dependencies used.
Therefore, after Nodejs is installed along with npm, one gets the dependencies
by running the following npm command:
    
    npm install

We would run the server file from the root path of all of the files, which is 
"/distributed-project". 

Therefore, the command used to run the Nodejs server file within the project's
main "/distributed-project" directory and get the web app working is:

    nodejs server.js
