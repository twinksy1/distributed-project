To run this web application, Nodejs is needed as well as the dependencies used.

We have provided the folder with the dependencies used, but they will likely
not work because they are not actually installed on the machine. To get the 
dependencies, if they do not work, the current dependencies folder must be 
deleted. Therfore, one must delete the "/node_modules" folder first by using 
the following command:

    rm -rf node_modules/

Now, after Nodejs is installed along with npm and the given dependencies folder
has been deleted, one needs to get the dependencies installed on their machine 
by running the following npm command:
    
    npm install

We would run the server file from the root path of all of the files, which is 
"/distributed-project". 

Therefore, the command used to run the Nodejs server file within the project's
main "/distributed-project" directory and get the web app working is:

    nodejs server.js
